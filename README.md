This is the ALX shell project that requires learners to code a simple command interpreter that works similar to the sh(Bourne shell).
This project helps students to implement concepts they have learnt in the first sprint of the ALX Software Engineering Program.
It is also a pair project that allows learners to explore their collaborative and team work abilities effectively.
